<h3>Bzees Cloud Technology</h3>
<p>
	I am currently redeveloping this project to be done in svelte. but in the meantime, checkout the
	code pen. Please keep in mind this code is more than 5 years old and I wouldn't write it like this
	today.

<!-- <p>
	Filled with magical unicorn down, Bzees Cloud Technology is designed to feel, well, like a cloudâ€¦
	weightless, energized and free.*
</p>
<p>
	*Bzees makes no claim to fully understand or know the deep, complex feelings of clouds. But, as
	friends to clouds, unicorns and many, many four-legged friends alike, we can stand by these
	attributes comfortably.
